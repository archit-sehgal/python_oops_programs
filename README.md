# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Problems in Python

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Problems in Python repository. In this project, I have solved various OOP problems using Python. These problems cover a range of OOP concepts and techniques.

## Problem Files

Here's a list of the Python code files included in this repository, each representing a specific OOP problem:

1. [rectangle.py](41.py) - Implementation of a Rectangle class.
2. [person_student.py](42.py) - Implementation of Person and Student classes.
3. [bank_account.py](43.py) - Implementation of a BankAccount class.
4. [circle.py](44.py) - Implementation of a Circle class.
5. [computation.py](45.py) - Implementation of a Computation class with various computational methods.
6. [book.py](46.py) - Implementation of a Book class.
7. [geometry.py](47.py) - Implementation of a Geometry class for geometric calculations.
8. [my_string.py](48.py) - Implementation of a MyString class for string manipulation.

Feel free to explore these Python code files to understand and learn from the OOP concepts they represent.
